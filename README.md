# PlayWrightAutomation

This project covers two powerful frameworks for designing test cases:

- Playwright Cucumber BDD Framework

- Playwright with Mocha

These two frameworks are built on top of page object design patterned tests, which take data from external sources and use custom utility methods to produce outstanding HTML reports.

Finally, the complete framework will be integrated with CI/CD Jenkins and use Docker containers to run the tests.

It's important to note that Playwright has powerful logging capabilities, including screenshots, videos, and built-in features called Playwright Inspector and Traces for a detailed view of post-execution. These features are demonstrated with live demos throughout the course.

In conclusion, this project is a one-stop shop for you to become a Playwright hero and take charge of modern, full end-to-end test automation.

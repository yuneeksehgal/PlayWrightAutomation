# PlayWrightAutomation

This project covers two powerful frameworks for designing test cases:

- Playwright Cucumber BDD Framework

- Playwright with Mocha

These two frameworks are built on top of page object design patterned tests, which take data from external sources and use custom utility methods to produce outstanding HTML reports.

Finally, the complete framework will be integrated with CI/CD Jenkins and use Docker containers to run the tests.

It's important to note that Playwright has powerful logging capabilities, including screenshots, videos, and built-in features called Playwright Inspector and Traces for a detailed view of post-execution. These features are demonstrated with live demos throughout the course.

Playwright Framework Features â€“

- Implement Page object Pattern for Web Automation tests

- Create API Utilities for Data setup and clean up

- How to drive test data from external files for Playwright tests

- How to Parameterize the tests with different data sets in Playwright

- Create Project Configurations with Playwright Config file

- Test Retry feature in Playwright and how it works

- How to record the video of test execution within Playwright framework

- Understand how tests run in parallel mode in Playwright Framework

- Test Annotations on run, skip, serial run & Parallel run

- Playwright Command Line Arguments options to run tests

- Detailed view of HTML Reporting with Trace viewer logs

- Generating Allure reporting for Playwright execution results

- How to create custom Scripts in package.json to trigger tests

- Integrate the Playwright framework with Jenkins CI/CD Jobs and Schedule runs

In conclusion, this project is a one-stop shop for you to become a Playwright hero and take charge of modern, full end-to-end test automation.
